# Cybersecurity Portfolio
This portfolio showcases my practical experience in cybersecurity through hands-on projects built in a controlled home lab environment. It demonstrates my ability to design, deploy, and manage secure IT environments, experiment with security tools, and document technical workflows for reproducibility.
