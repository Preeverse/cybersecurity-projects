# SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) Lab

## What is SIEM?
**Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** is a comprehensive solution that allows organizations to collect and analyze security event data from across their network. SIEMs provide the ability to:
- **Aggregate logs** from various network devices, servers, and applications.
- **Detect threats** by analyzing event data for suspicious behavior.
- **Generate alerts** when potential security incidents are identified.
- **Create dashboards and reports** for security monitoring, compliance, and auditing.
